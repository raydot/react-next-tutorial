				  <p>I love wine tasting at the actual winery because they normally don’t distribute all their wines, so going to a winery is the only place to taste their entire portfolio. Where do you start? What are the costs? Will the wine be any good? Tasting fees can easily sneak up on you, and that’s not even the cost of the wine. I wanted a program that was all about wine exploration—about getting out to the wine regions and trying and exploring.</p>

<p>The Wine Explorer Membership™ is a curated list of wineries that are somewhat under the radar. They are the hidden gems, the ones you might have missed looking at a wine map. With the card, you can taste gratis, try new wines you might have not normally ventured to taste and expand your winery exploration. </p>
